# nr-querypack

querypack is a serialization format designed for use by the New Relic Browser Agent.

This repository also contains a reference encoder and decoder (`qputil`) to produce querypack from JSON, and to decode querypack to JSON. It also contains querypack schemas and test-cases meant to be consumed by other parser / encoder implementations. The schema used by the Browser Agent is called `bel`, and it is currently used to serialize information about single-page app route changes.

For details about the design of the querypack format, see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr-querypack.git
$ cd nr-querypack
$ npm install
```

## Getting Started

The schema used by the Browser Agent is defined in the [schemas/bel](schemas/bel) directory.

To encode a JSON message, use the following command:

```
node bin/qputil.js encode <filename>.json schemas/bel/7.qpschema
```

To decode a message from querypack to JSON, use the following command:

```
node bin/qputil.js decode <filename>.querypack
```

## Usage

```
$ bin/qputil.js encode <filename>.json schemas/<schemaName>.qpschema
$ bin/qputil.js decode <filename>.querypack
$ bin/qputil.js validate <filename>.querypack schemas/<schemaName>.qpschema
```

If you have it in your clipboard, you can use it like this:

```
pbpaste | tr -d '[:space:]' | bin/qputil.js decode - | less
```

### Adding new bel schema version

Sometimes when developing a new feature, the structure of the serialized data the Browser Agent sends needs to change.
To do this, follow the example structure below, to create files with an updated version of the schema:

- examples/bel/CURRENT_VERSION/\*
- schema/bel/CURRENT_VERSION.qpschema

Any changes to the bel schema should require a new version bump.

This version bump is not a breaking change because each version lives in a separate file, but will require an update to the agent to encode the new format and the data processing pipeline to decode using the new format.

## Testing

Compile & run test cases, schemas, grammar and parser for QueryPack:

```
$ npm test
```
